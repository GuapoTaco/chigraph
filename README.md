# What is chigraph?
Chigraph,  pronunced chai-graph, is a new systems programming language. It's fast. It's scalable. And, more importantly, it's easy to learn. How does it achieve such goals? By scrapping the age-old standard of text (not entirely though).

# Components
Chigraph is made up of three components:

## libchigraph
libchigraph is the chigraph library that provides all functions for chigraph clients, like code generation, graph representation, etc. Want to compile a chigraph module using libchigraph?

```C++
#include <chi/Context.hpp>

int main() {
    chi::Contxt myContext{"/path/to/workspace"};
	myContxt.loadModule("github.com/russelltg/hellochigraph");
	
	llvm::Module* mod;
	myContxt.compileModule("github.com/russelltg/hellochigraph", &mod);
}
```

And tada, you have yourself a [`llvm::Module`](http://llvm.org/docs/doxygen/html/classllvm_1_1Module.html) to do whatever you wish to. It'll have all it's dependencies linked in and a main function waiting to run.

## chi
chi is the command line interface to chigraph. It lets you compile and run chigraph modules:
```bash
$ pwd
~/chigrpah/src/github.com/russelltg/hellochigraph
$ chi run hellochigraph.chigmod
Hello World!
```

## chigraphgui
Chigraphgui is the graphical user interface for writing chigraph modules, written in [Qt5](https://qt.io) and [KDE Frameworks 5](https://api.kde.org/frameworks/index.html). It's cross-platform, easy to use, and simple.
